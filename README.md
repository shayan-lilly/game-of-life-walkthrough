# Conway's Game of Life

This repository contains an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a simple and interactive implementation of Conway's Game of Life. The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it runs directly in the web browser.

## Current Implementation

- The game grid is displayed on an HTML canvas.
- Cells are represented as circles that change color based on the number of live neighbors.
- The game updates every 0.5 seconds.
- The colors used for the cells are inspired by GitHub's contribution graph: `#9be9a8`, `#40c463`, `#30a14e`, `#216e39`.
